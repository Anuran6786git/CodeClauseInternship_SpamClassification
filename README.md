# Spam-Classification-Project
The Spam Classification AI project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying messages as spam or non-spam. Spam messages, also known as unsolicited or unwanted messages, can be a significant nuisance and pose security risks. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to automatically identify and filter out spam messages from a given dataset.

#procedure

 1.Dataset of  messages Gatherd  containing labeled examples of both spam and non-spam messages.
 
 
 2. The data is Clean and preprocessd  by removing unnecessary characters, handling special symbols, and performing text normalization.

 3. Exploratory data analysis is conducted to understand the distribution of spam and non-spam messages.
 
 4. Feature extraction techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings is Implemented to represent the textual data as numerical features.

 5. A machine learning algorithm for spam classification is chosen. Options include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or more advanced models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers.
 
 6. The chosen model is implemented and trained using the preprocessed data. Fine-tuned hyperparameters and experiment with different configurations to achieve optimal performance.
 
 7.  The model's performance is Evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
 
 8.   The model is Optimized by fine-tuning hyperparameters and exploring advanced techniques. Considering cross-validation to ensure robust performance.
